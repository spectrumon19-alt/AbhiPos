# Add Item Button Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Sales Page**: The `currentSelectedProduct` variable was declared at the end of the file, causing scope issues when the "Add Item" button tried to access it.

2. **Purchase Page**: The `currentSelectedProduct` variable was declared in the middle of the script, which could cause scope issues in some browsers or execution environments.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Sales Page (sales.js)
- Moved the `currentSelectedProduct` variable declaration from the end of the file to the top with other global variables.
- This ensures the variable is available in the proper scope when the "Add Item" button click handler executes.

### 2. Purchase Page (purchase.html)
- Moved the `currentSelectedProduct` variable declaration from the middle of the script to the top with other global variables.
- This ensures consistent scoping across all browsers and execution environments.

## How the Fix Works

The issue was related to JavaScript variable hoisting and scope. When a variable is declared later in the code but referenced earlier, it can lead to `undefined` values, which causes the "Add Item" button to fail with an error like "Cannot read property 'product_id' of undefined".

By moving the variable declarations to the top of their respective scopes, we ensure that:
1. The variables are properly initialized before any functions try to use them
2. The scope is consistent across different JavaScript engines
3. The code follows best practices for variable declaration

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Open the sales page and try to add an item after selecting a product
2. Open the purchase page and try to add an item after selecting a product
3. Both "Add Item" buttons should now work correctly

## Files Modified

- `sales.js` - Moved `currentSelectedProduct` variable declaration
- `purchase.html` - Moved `currentSelectedProduct` variable declaration

The fixes are minimal and focused, addressing only the specific scoping issues without changing any other functionality.
