# POS System - Development Summary

## Project Overview

We have successfully created a complete Point of Sale (POS) system with the following components:

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- RESTful API with JWT authentication
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Role-based access control (Admin/Cashier)
- Complete business logic for sales, purchases, and inventory

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Modern CSS with Flexbox and Grid
- No external frameworks (pure HTML/CSS/JS)
- Complete user interface for all system functions

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Users table with roles (Admin/Cashier)
- Products table with GST rates
- Inventory tracking
- Sales invoices and line items
- Sample data for testing

### 2. Authentication System
- Secure login with JWT tokens
- Password hashing with passlib
- Role-based access control

### 3. Sales Management
- Product search with autocomplete
- Real-time invoice calculation with GST (SGST/CGST)
- Save and print functionality
- Dynamic invoice table

### 4. Purchase Management
- Supplier information tracking
- Stock receiving interface
- Purchase rate management

### 5. Inventory Management
- Real-time stock tracking
- Low stock alerts
- Stock adjustment functionality

### 6. Reporting
- Sales summary reports
- Date range filtering
- Top-selling products
- Visual charts with Chart.js

### 7. Administration
- Product CRUD operations
- User management
- Invoice viewing and cancellation
- Role-based permissions

## Files Created

### Backend Files
- `app.py` - Main Flask application
- `db.py` - Database connection utilities
- `auth.py` - Authentication and JWT utilities
- `schema.sql` - Database schema and sample data
- Route handlers for all modules (auth, products, sales, etc.)

### Frontend Files
- `start.html` - Welcome page
- `login.html` - Authentication interface
- `dashboard.html` - Main navigation
- `index.html` - Sales interface
- `purchase.html` - Stock receiving
- `inventory.html` - Inventory management
- `reports.html` - Sales reporting
- `admin.html` - Admin panel
- `receipt.html` - Printable receipts
- `styles.css` - Responsive styling
- `sales.js` - Client-side logic

### Configuration & Documentation
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- Setup and run scripts for Windows/Unix
- Comprehensive documentation files

## Business Logic

### GST Calculations
For each invoice item:
- S.Amount = Quantity Ã— Selling Rate
- S.Exclusive GST = S.Amount / (1 + (GST Rate / 100))
- Total GST = S.Amount - S.Exclusive GST
- SGST = Total GST / 2
- CGST = Total GST / 2

### Inventory Management
- Stock decremented on sales
- Stock incremented on purchases
- Stock restored when invoices are cancelled

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3, Flask, psycopg2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Security**: JWT, passlib
- **Deployment**: Standalone Flask server

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure database in `.env` file
3. Initialize database: `python init_db.py`
4. Run application: `python app.py`
5. Access at `http://localhost:5000`

## Default Credentials

- **Admin**: username `admin`, password `admin123`
- **Cashier**: username `cashier`, password `cashier123`

## Testing

The application has been tested for:
- Module imports
- Database connectivity
- API endpoint functionality
- Frontend responsiveness
- Business logic calculations

## Security Features

- Password hashing with passlib
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Protected API endpoints
- Input validation

## Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible layouts with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Cross-device compatibility

This POS system is ready for deployment and meets all requirements specified in the original task.
