## Deployment Requirements

### Server Requirements
1. **Python 3.7+** installed
2. **PostgreSQL** database server
3. **At least 1GB RAM** recommended
4. **500MB disk space** for application and database

### Network Requirements
1. **Port 5001** available (configurable)
2. **HTTPS recommended** for production deployment
3. **Firewall access** to database port (5432 by default)

### Dependencies
All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`:
- Flask==2.3.2
- Flask-CORS==4.0.0
- psycopg2-binary==2.9.7
- passlib==1.7.4
- PyJWT==2.8.0
- python-dotenv==1.0.0

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd pos-system

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Database Configuration
1. Create PostgreSQL database
2. Update `.env` file with database credentials
3. Initialize schema:
   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```

### 3. Application Configuration
Update `.env` file with:
```env
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secure-secret-key-here
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

### 4. Start Application
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5001`

## Default User Accounts

- **Admin**: 
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`
  
- **Cashier**: 
  - Username: `cashier`
  - Password: `cashier123`

## Security Considerations

### For Production Deployment
1. Change default passwords immediately
2. Generate a strong SECRET_KEY
3. Enable HTTPS with SSL/TLS
4. Configure firewall rules
5. Set up database backups
6. Implement proper logging
7. Consider using a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn)

### Access Control
- Admin users have full system access
- Cashier users have limited access (sales, purchase, inventory, reports)
- All API endpoints are protected with JWT tokens
- Passwords are securely hashed with passlib

## Performance Considerations

1. The system has been tested with multiple concurrent users
2. Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
3. Consider using a production WSGI server for better performance
4. Monitor resource usage under load

## Backup and Recovery

1. Regular database backups are recommended
2. Application files should be version controlled
3. Keep a copy of the `.env` file in a secure location
4. Test restore procedures regularly

## Monitoring

1. Application logs are available in the terminal
2. Database logs should be monitored
3. Set up alerts for critical errors
4. Monitor disk space and memory usage

## Conclusion

The POS System is fully functional and ready for deployment. All tests have passed successfully, and the system meets all requirements specified in the project documentation. The system has been tested for:

- ✅ User authentication and authorization
- ✅ Product management
- ✅ Sales processing with GST calculations
- ✅ Inventory tracking
- ✅ Purchase management
- ✅ Reporting capabilities
- ✅ Administrative functions
- ✅ Responsive web interface

With proper security measures and production deployment practices, this system is ready to be used in a live business environment.
